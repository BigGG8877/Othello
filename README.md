# Othello
A simple game to learn, a lifetime to master


Current state:

	I think that all of the horizontal directions work. 
	
	This will probably break when you get closer to the ends of the board
	and we will need to work on the `board.inRow` function as life goes on.
	
	Also implementation of diagonals seems important.
